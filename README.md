# TensorFlow Project

This is the project I did when I studied tensorflow.

Most of them come from online cases.

*If you are using older TensorFlow version (0.11 and under), please have a [look here](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/tree/0.11).*

## Index

### pause

## Dataset

Please refer to the **README.md** of each chapter for details.

## Installation

To download all the examples, simply clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/shiyipasiizuo/tensorflow-project.git
```

To run them, you also need the latest version of TensorFlow. To install it:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

or (if you want GPU support):
```
pip install tensorflow_gpu
```

For more details about TensorFlow installation, you can check [TensorFlow Installation Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

## More Examples
The following examples are coming from [TFLearn](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn), a library that provides a simplified interface for TensorFlow. You can have a look, there are many [examples](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/tree/master/examples) and [pre-built operations and layers](http://tflearn.org/doc_index/#api).

## Tutorials

- [TFLearn Quickstart](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/tutorials/intro/quickstart.md). Learn the basics of TFLearn through a concrete machine learning task. Build and train a deep neural network classifier.

## Examples
